    "### Audio features:\n",
    "The complete list of the implemented short-term features is presented below:\n",
    "- **Zero Crossing Rate**: The rate of sign-changes of the signal during the duration of a particular frame.\n",
    "- **Energy**: The sum of squares of the signal values, normalized by the respective frame length.\n",
    "- **Entropy of Energy**: The entropy of sub-frames' normalized energies. It can be interpreted as a measure of abrupt changes.\n",
    "- **Spectral Centroid**: The center of gravity of the spectrum.\n",
    "- **Sprectral Spread**: The second central moment of the spectrum.\n",
    "- **Spectral Entropy**: Entropy of the normalized spectral energies for a set of sub-frames.\n",
    "- **Spectral Flux**: The squared difference between the normalized magnitudes of the spectra of the two successive frames.\n",
    "- **Spectral Rolloff**: The frequency below which 90% of the magnitude distribution of the spectrum is concentrated.\n",
    "- **MFCCS**: Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients form a cepstral representation where the frequency bands are not linear but distributed according to the mel-scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Statistics are then computed on upper features:\n",

    "### Data:\n",
    "**RAVDESS**: The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) contains 7356 files (total size: 24.8 GB). The database contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech includes *calm*, *happy*, *sad*, *angry*, *fearful*, *surprise*, and *disgust* expressions, and song contains calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful emotions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression. (https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.XA48aC17Q1J)"
